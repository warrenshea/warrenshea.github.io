## The New One Minute Manager by Ken Blanchard and Spencer Johnson
"The essence of knowledge is, having it, to use it" - Confucius

"People who feel good about themselves produce good results"
"Help people reach their full potential"
"Catch them doing something right"
"The best minute I spend is the one I invest in people"
"Everyone is a potential winner. Some people are disguised as losers. Don't let their appearances fool you."
"Take a minute: Look at your goals. Look at your performance. See if your behaviour matches your goals."
"We are not just our behaviour. We are the person managing our behaviour."
"Goals begin behaviours. Consequences maintain behaviours."

**The First Secret: One Minute Goals**
Instead of setting goals for us, he works with us to develop them
Each goal should take no more than a paragraph to express, so it can be read in a minute.
80/20 - 80% of your results will come from your 20% goals (3-5 goals)
Anything that is done should be towards the goals


If you can't tell me what you'd like to be happening, you don't have a problem yet - you're just complaining.
A problem only exists if there's a difference between what is actually happening and what you desire to be happening.
  What are people doing or not doing?
  What would you like people to do?
What's the descrepency between the actual and what you want to happen?


***One Minute Goals: Summary***
One Minute Goals work well when you:
Plan the goals together and describe them briefly and clearly. Show people what good performance looks like.
Have people write out each of their goals, with due dates, on a single page.
Ask them to review their most important goals each day, which takes only a few minutes to do.
Encourage people to take a minute to look at what they're doing, and see if their behaviour matches their goals.
If it doesn't, encourage them to re-think what they're doing so they can realise their goals sooner.

***One Minute Praisings: Summary***
One Minute Praisings work well when you:

The first half-minute
  1. Praise people as soon as possible.
  2. Let people know what they did right - be specific.
  3. Tell people how good you feel about what they did right, and how it helps.
Pause
  1. Pause for a moment to allow people time to feel good about what they've done.
The second half-minute
  1. Encourage them to do more of the same.
  2. Make it clear you have confidence in them and support their success.

***One Minute Re-Directs: Summary***
If the goal is clear, a One Minute Re-Direct works well when you:

The first half-minute
  1. Re-Direct people as soon as possible.
  2. Confirm the facts first, and review the mistake together - be specific.
  3. Express how you feel about the mistake and its impact on results.
Pause
  1. Be quiet for a moment to allow people time to feel concerned about what they've done.
The second half-minute
  1. Remember to let them know that they're better than their mistake, and that you think well of them as a person.
  2. Remind them that you have confidence and trust in them, and support their success.
  3. Realize that when the Re-Direct is over, it's over.
