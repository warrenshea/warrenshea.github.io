## Part 1: The Habits of Individuals

### Chapter 1: The Habit Loop - How Habits Work

*Audible 23:30 - 1:27:00 | Page 1-30*

Eugene Polly (EP) - Due to health issues, gained short term memory disability.\
HM - Seizures throughout his life. Gave permission/consent to do risky surgery, which reduced his seizures, but his memory had been erased. He couldn't retain any new information for more than 20 seconds.

Rats going through maze\
Basil Ganglia - stores habits, converts actions into automatic routine (called "chunking").\
Habits emerge because the brain is looking for ways to save effort (allowing the mind to ramp down more often), allowing our brain to think less.

Habits look for a cue / trigger to start, then starts the routine (which is physical, mental, or emotional) and ends on the reward. This helps our brain figure out if this is worth remembering in the future. Enough of this causes a craving, which creates a habit.

Habits reduce decision making.

The brain cannot determine the difference between good and bad habits.

Both good and bad habits cannot change - but you can override habits.

Game of cards (face down), laid out in the same spots. Eugene had to guess which were the correct cards. He couldn't remember what the exercise was, but due to the habit loop (cue - card placements, and reward - "correct symbol"), he got close to 100% after time.

### Chapter 2: The Craving Brain - How to Create New Habits

*Audible 1:27:00 - 2:32:22 | Page 30-59*

Claude C. Hopkins - Advertiser\
Best known for Rules to create new habits

Craving creates the habit loop\
Find a simple and obvious cue - then clearly define the rewards (e.g. Tooth film -> Beautiful teeth)\
Exercise is more successful if there is a cue and reward\
Research on dieting requires cue (meal plans) and rewards (guilt free TV watching)

Drake Stinson - a rising executive for selling Fabreeze\
Fabreeze failed because the cue, bad smell, was hidden from the people that needed it most.

Monkey that got juice from trigger.\
When the juice did not arrive/was watered down, it created a craving.

Habit Loop: Cue -> Routine -> Reward -> Craving that restarts

Cravings production addiction like reaction: Wanting evolves into obsessive craving that can force our brains into auto pilot, even in the face of loss of reputation, job, home, family

Cinnabon - want the smell to travel, uninterrupted

Exercise habits start on a whim - but the reward has to be positive and an individual has to crave the reward.

To modify a habit, you must decide to change it\
You must consciously accept the hard work of identifying the queues and rewards that drive the habit's routines and find alternatives\
You must know you have control and be self conscious enough to use it.\
Once you know a habit exists, you have the responsibility to change it.\
Once you understand that habits can change, you have the freedom and responsibility to remake them\
Once you understand that habits can be rebuilt, the power of habit is easier to grasp and the only option left is to get to work\
The will to believe is the most important ingredient to believe in change\

Thousands of formulas for changing habits\
Each person's habits are driven by different cravings.\
Identify the a habit loop: Cue, Routine, Reward. Implant old vices with new routines.\
e.g. Eating a cookie every afternoon while socializing at the cafe\
Change the loop with experiments\
After each activity, jot first 3 things that come to mind when you get back to your desk\
Set an alarm for 15m and ask yourself - do you feel the urge for that cookie?\
Writing down forces momentary awareness for what you are thinking/feeling. Your words will give to recollection.\
