<li>&quot;Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and to remove all doubt&quot; - Abraham Lincoln</li>
<li>&quot;Everyone fails at who they&#39;re supposed to be. The measure of a person is how well they succeed at being who they are&quot; - Frigga (Avengers Endgame)</li>
<li>&quot;You can&#39;t wait until life isn&#39;t hard anymore before you decide to be happy&quot; - Nightbirde</li>
<li>&quot;The simplest and most significant lesson of all...&#39;It&#39;s not about you&#39;&quot; - The Ancient One (Doctor Strange)</li>
<li>&quot;Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain&#39;t all sunshine and rainbows. It&#39;s a very mean and nasty place, and I don&#39;t care how tough you are, it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain&#39;t about how hard you&#39;re hit. It&#39;s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward; how much you can take and keep moving forward. That&#39;s how winning is done! Now, if you know what you&#39;re worth, then go out and get what you&#39;re worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain&#39;t where you wanna be because of him, or her, or anybody. Cowards do that and that ain&#39;t you. You&#39;re better than that!&quot; - Rocky Balboa (Rocky Balboa)</li>
<li>&quot;The more you know who you are and what you want, the less you let things upset you.&quot; Bob Harris (Lost in Translation)</li>
<li>&quot;Don&#39;t ever let someone tell you, you can&#39;t do something. Not even me. You got a dream, you got to protect it. People can’t do something themselves, they want to tell you you can’t do it. You want something, go get it. Period.&quot; - Chris Gardner (The Pursuit of Happyness)</li>
