## QBQ! The Question Behind The Question by John G. Miller
What has happened to Personal Accountability?
QBQ helps practice personal accountability by asking better questions of ourselves.

***Chapter 1: A Picture of Presonal Accountability***
Restaurant story w/ Diet Coke
"Why do I have to do everything around here?" "When is management going to provide us with X?" "Why are we short staffed?"
These are lousy questions - negative and don't solve problems. IQ: Incorrect Questions since nothing positive or productive comes from them?
"What can I do to make a difference?" "How can I support the team?"
The QBQ is a Tool that enables individuals to practice personal accountability by making better choices in the moment.
We accomplish this by asking better questions of ourselves.

***Chapter 2: Making Better Choices***

***Chapter 3: The Question Behind the Question***
QBQs are questions we ask ourselves, not others
Guidelines for creating a QBQ
1. Begin with "What" or "How", not "Why" "When" or "Who"
2. Contain an "I", not "We", "They", or "You"
3. Focus on Action
"What can I do?"

***Chapter 4: Don't ask why***
"Why don't others work harder?" "Why is this happening to me?" "Why don't people care as much as I do?"
Get rid of victim thinking

***Chapter 5: The Victim***

***Chapter 6: Why is this happening to me?***
Stress is a choice because whatever the trigger event, we always choose our own response

"How can I adapt to the changing world"

***Chapter 8: Why don't THEY communicate better?***

***Chapter 9: Don't ask 'When'***

"How can I apply what I'm hearing, even if I've heard it before." is an QBQ

***Chapter 13: Don't ask 'Who'?***
Who is looking for scapegoats, someone else to blame
