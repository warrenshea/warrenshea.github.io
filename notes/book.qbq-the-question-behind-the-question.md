## QBQ! The Question Behind The Question by John G. Miller
What has happened to Personal Accountability?
QBQ helps practice personal accountability by asking better questions of ourselves.

### Chapter 1: A Picture of Presonal Accountability
* Restaurant story w/ Diet Coke
* "Why do I have to do everything around here?" "When is management going to provide us with X?" "Why are we short staffed?"
* These are lousy questions - negative and don't solve problems. IQ: Incorrect Questions since nothing positive or productive comes from them?
* "What can I do to make a difference?" "How can I support the team?"
* The QBQ is a Tool that enables individuals to practice personal accountability by making better choices in the moment.
* We accomplish this by asking better questions of ourselves.

### Chapter 2: Making Better Choices

QBQs are questions we ask ourselves, not others \

Guidelines for creating a QBQ

2. Contain an "I", not "We", "They", or "You"
3. Focus on Action

"What can I do?"

* Get rid of victim thinking

### Chapter 5: The Victim

### Chapter 13: Don't ask 'Who'?
* Who is looking for scapegoats, someone else to blame

### Chapter 14: "A poor sailor blames the wind"?

### Chapter 20: Making accountability personal. All QBQs contain an "I" (not 'they', 'we', or 'you')
* The only things are have any control over our own thoughts and actions

### Chapter 21: I can only change me
* "I can only change me" but when listening, "who needs the QBQ? 'they' do"

### Chapter 27: Will the real role models please stand up?
* No matter what our role, someone is watching and emulating our behaviour and we may be influencing them through our choices and actions. Modelling is the most powerful of all teachers.
* "How can I set a better example?"

### Chapter 28: Practicing Personal Accountability - all QBQs focus on action
* If we don't ask what we 'can do', 'or make', 'or achieve', 'or build', then we won't do, or make, or achieve or build
* Only though action is anything accomplished - we discipline our thoughts, we ask better questions, we take action

### Chapter 29: The risk of doing nothing
Taking action may seem risky, but doing nothing is a bigger risk

Action, even when it leads to mistakes, brings learning and growth \
Inaction bring stagnation and atrophy

Action leads us towards solutions \
Inaction does nothing and holds us in the past

Action requires courage \
Inaction often indicates fear

Action builds confidence \
Inaction builds doubt

"It is better to be one who is told to wait than one who waits to be told"

* Moment to moment discipline of our thoughts
* Choosing to make a positive contribution no matter what our role or level
* If we think like leaders, we are leaders

### Chapter 32: The cornerstone of leadership
* Leaders don't say "you succeed, and then I'll serve you" but rather "I will serve you so you can succeed"

### Chapter 33: Accountability and boundaries

3. Focus on Action

The spirit is Personal Accountability - no more victim thinking, complaining, procrastinatings or blaming. I can only change me. Take action.

Most QBQs happen in our minds. It's about asking better questions of ourselves

### Chapter 36: Wisdom
What we learn after we know it all. Personal accountability is moment to moment discipline of our thoughts, not a destination

### Chapter 37: We buy too many books/too many seminars/too many podcasts
Training is all a waste if we're unclear on what learning really is - Learning is not attending, listening, or reading, nor gaining knowledge. \
Learning is about translating knowing what to do into doing what we know - it's about changing \
Learning = Change \
If we haven't changed, we haven't learned.

### Chapter 38: A final picture
My mess, my responsibility

### Chapter 39: The motor of learning
* Repetition is the motor of learning
* Listen to it again
