<ul>
<li>I learned never to kill someone’s spirit if they come to you with a big idea. Instead, ask questions to find out their level of faith and commitment to their vision. Empowering your employees to drive towards goals that align with the company’s broader vision will contribute to your flywheel momentum.</li>
<li>Secondly, I realized that people want wins they can call their own. Any good leader will foster an entrepreneurial spirit in others because at the end of the day, what’s good for corporate culture is good for the bottom line.</li>
<li>Finally, ask “Can you imagine?” It’s an open-ended question that generates huge ideas and passion projects from you and your staff. With the right support, these blue-sky visions are achievable and may be the next big thing for you and your company.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;If you need to ask &#39;what do I need to do to get this role?&quot;, then you&#39;re not ready. Before jumping into a role, you should be done some of it already.</li>
<li>If you are in a position to make change, make sure you observe and change what doesn&#39;t work and ensure you are not harming the things that work well.</li>
</ul>
