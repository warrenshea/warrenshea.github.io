<h1>The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg</h1><h2>Prologue:</h2><p><em>Audible: 0:00-23:30 | Page: xi - xx</em></p>
<p>Lisa - an individual who was a mess, but got her life together after changing her habits</p>
<p>Her keystone habit - quitting smoking, changed all other aspects of her life</p>
<p>Situation:</p>
<p>Violence was proceeded by crowd in open space - food vendors, spectators appear and once violence started, all hell would break loose.</p>
<p>Request: Keep food vendors out of the plaza.</p>
<p>Result: Crowd in open space. At dusk, the crowd got restless and hungry. With no food vendors, the spectators left, the chanters became dispirited, and everyone was gone.</p>
<h2>Part 1: The Habits of Individuals</h2><h2>Chapter 1: The Habit Loop - How Habits Work</h2><p><em>Audible 23:30 - 1:27:00 | Page 1-30</em></p>
<p>Eugene Polly (EP) - Due to health issues, gained short term memory disability.</p>
<p>HM - Seizures throughout his life. Gave permission/consent to do risky surgery, which reduced his seizures, but his memory had been erased. He couldn&#39;t retain any new information for more than 20 seconds.</p>
<p>Rats going through maze</p>
<p>Basil Ganglia - stores habits, converts actions into automatic routine (called &quot;chunking&quot;).</p>
<p>Habits emerge because the brain is looking for ways to save effort (allowing the mind to ramp down more often), allowing our brain to think less.</p>
<p>Habits look for a cue / trigger to start, then starts the routine (which is physical, mental, or emotional) and ends on the reward. This helps our brain figure out if this is worth remembering in the future. Enough of this causes a craving, which creates a habit.</p>
<p>Habits reduce decision making.</p>
<p>The brain cannot determine the difference between good and bad habits.</p>
<p>Both good and bad habits cannot change - but you can override habits.</p>
<p>Game of cards (face down), laid out in the same spots. Eugene had to guess which were the correct cards. He couldn&#39;t remember what the exercise was, but due to the habit loop (cue - card placements, and reward - &quot;correct symbol&quot;), he got close to 100% after time.</p>

<p>Craving creates the habit loop</p>

<p>Research on dieting requires cue (meal plans) and rewards (guilt free TV watching)</p>
<p>Drake Stinson - a rising executive for selling Fabreeze</p>
<p>Fabreeze failed because the cue, bad smell, was hidden from the people that needed it most.</p>
<p>Monkey that got juice from trigger.</p>

<p>Habit Loop: Cue -&gt; Routine -&gt; Reward -&gt; Craving that restarts</p>
<p>Cravings production addiction like reaction: Wanting evolves into obsessive craving that can force our brains into auto pilot, even in the face of loss of reputation, job, home, family</p>

<p>Exercise habits start on a whim - but the reward has to be positive and an individual has to crave the reward.</p>
